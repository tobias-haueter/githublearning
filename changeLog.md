## [Unreleased]()



## [0.1.0]() - 2021-04-13

### Added

- Better explanation of the difference between the file ("CHANGELOG") and its function "the change log".

### Changed

- Refer to a "change log" instead of a "CHANGELOG" throughout the site to differentiate between the file and the purpose of the file â€” the logging of changes.

### Removed

- Remove empty sections from CHANGELOG, they occupy too much space and create too much noise in the file. People will have to assume that the missing sections were intentionally left out because they contained no notable changes.
